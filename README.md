# Pokemon

This is my first independent (i.e., not following a Codecademy prompt or project) data analysis project. It involves analyzing data about characters in the Pokemon series of games. I got interested in this particular data set because I on occasion play the Pokemon Go game, and having never played any Pokemon games as a child I wanted a better understanding of what sorts of statistics and characteristics were associated with the various characters. It was also a small data set, which I felt would be best for a first independent project.

I carried out this project using Python 3.8 and Jupyter Notebook; packages used include Pandas and Matplotlib. I've included my Jupyter Notebook as 'pokemon_MAC.ipynb.'

The data set I used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle.com, and more speciifically from the URL https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon. The individual who compiled the data set, Rounak Banik, scraped the data from http://serebii.net/. The data set was released under the CC0 public domain license (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and was last updated in September 2017. Since the data set was released under a Public Domain license, I am able to post it here. The file is "pokemon.csv."

In this project, I investigated my own Pokemon pokedex, or at least the English names of the various Pokemon, their associated pokedex number, and whether or not I have found one. I have included this file as "MAC_pokemon.csv." 

 Nintendo owns the rights to the Pokemon series of games; Niantic created the Pokemon Go game.
